# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to implement a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying images into one of 10 categories (e.g., airplane, automobile, bird, etc.).

# Steps Involved:
Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset is used, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
Preprocessing:
Normalize the pixel values of images (scale them to [0,1]).
One-hot encode the labels.
Model Architecture:
Three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers.
Flatten layer to convert the 2D features into a 1D vector.
Fully connected (dense) layers for classification.
Model Training:
Train the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
Plot the accuracy and loss curves during training.
Results Visualization:
Show example images from the test set with predicted and actual labels.
Display visualizations of model performance (accuracy and loss curves).
# Key Objectives:
Model Design:

Implement a CNN model using TensorFlow.
Ensure the model uses appropriate layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, etc.) for effective feature extraction and classification.
Preprocessing and Data Augmentation:

Preprocess the CIFAR-10 images by normalizing them and encoding the labels.
Optionally apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
Training and Optimization:

Train the model using the training dataset and evaluate performance on the validation/test set.
Experiment with hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) to optimize model performance.
Evaluation:

Use metrics such as accuracy and loss for model evaluation.
Visualize model predictions and show the accuracy/loss curves.
Visualization:

Display a few sample images from the test set along with the predicted and actual labels.
Plot training and validation accuracy and loss to monitor model performance over time.
Deliverables:
Functional Model:
A trained model capable of classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The model should output predictions with an accuracy suitable for the problem.
Visualization of Results:
Visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss using matplotlib.
Display sample test images along with their predicted and actual labels.
